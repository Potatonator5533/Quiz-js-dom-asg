JS DOM Assignment

In the center of the box grid, there are two input fields and two buttons. The first input tells the code what box the user wants to target and the second input field tells the code what to change the background color of the selected box to, Red, Blue, Purple, Brown and Yellow. The the first button feeds the user's inputs into the code and the second button sets all 8 boxes back to their original state.
