JS DOM Assignment

In the center of the box grid, there are two input fields and two buttons. The first input tells the code what box the user wants to target and the second input field tells the code what to change the background color of the selected box to, Red, Blue, Purple, Brown and Yellow. The the first button feeds the user's inputs into the code and the second button sets all 8 boxes back to their original state.

Peer Name: Bronel Lazar
Peer Review: Everything seems to function properly! I can change the color of the individual boxes to any of the colors that were given in the assignment and no other color is accepted, the button to reset the boxes works properly as well. I like your use of the switch statements to check the user's input, good work!
